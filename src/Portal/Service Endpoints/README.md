##### Service Endpoints

---

1. Service Endpoint to Storage Account Service has been enabled only for the subnet **app-subnet** and _not_ for the subnet **app-subnet-002**.

2. Hence the VM hosted in the app-subnet is allowed to access the blobs where as the VM hosted in the app-subnet-002 cannot access it.
